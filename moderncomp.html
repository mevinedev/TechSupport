            <p>  Ports are connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer.</p> <br>
            <p>  CPU as the brain of our computer. The CPU does all the calculations and data processing. It communicates pretty heavily with Random Access Memory.</p> <br>
            <p> Ram is our computer's short-term memory. We use this component when we want to store data temporarily.</p> <br>
            <p>  The hard drive holds all our data, which can include music, pictures, applications. </p> <br>
            <p> motherboard holds everything in place and let's our components communicate with each other. </p> <br>
            <p> power supply converts the electricity from our wall outlet onto a format that our computer can use</p>
        </div>
        <div> 
            <p> overclocking - exceeding the number of clock cycles on a CPU order to perform more tasks. 
                This is commonly used to increase the performance in low-end CPUs 
            EDB is a row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer, kind of like the veins in our body. 
            The MCC sends data grabbed from the RAM and sends it to the CPU through the EDB.
        Random Access Memory (RAM) stores data temporarily. Registers store the data that the CPU works with.

   <div> <h2> CPU </h2>
    <p> instruction set - which is a list of instructions that our CPU is able to run. 
        Instruction sets are hard-coded into our CPU so different CPU manufacturers may use different instruction sets, but they generally perform the same functions. 
        popular CPU manufacturers or chipsets, like Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. These CPU manufacturers use different product names to differentiate their processes. 
        Like Intel Core i7, AMD Athlon, Snapdragon 810, Apple A8, and more.
        When you select your CPU, you need to make sure it's compatible with your motherboard.
        Your CPU might have lots of tiny pins that are either stick out or have contact points that look like dots. 
        Depending on your motherboard, you need to make sure these CPUs fit correctly in the socket. 
        There are currently two major types of CPU sockets; Land Grid Array, also known as LGA, and Pin Grid Array, also known as PGA. 
        In an LGA socket there are pins that stick out of the motherboard. The socket size may vary, so always make sure your CPU and socket are compatible beforehand. 
        the PGA socket, where the pins are located on the processor itself. When we installed our CPU, we need to do a few things to it to keep it cool.
        Since it does a lot of work, it's prone to overheating. We have to make sure to include a heat sink too which takes the heat from our CPU and dissipates it through a fan or another medium.
        CPUs that have 32-bit or 64-bit architecture are just specifying how much data they can efficiently handle

<div> <h2> RAM </h2>
    <p> RAM is our computers short-term memory. We use RAM to store data that we want to access quickly. This data changes all the time so it isn't permanent. 
        Almost all RAM is volatile, which means that once we power off our machines, the data stored in RAM is cleared.
        To run a program, we need to make a copy of it in RAM so our CPU can process it.
        An example of RAM is dynamic random-access memory, it stores each bit in a microscopic capacitor, this is either charged or discharged, represented by 1 or a 0. These semiconductors are put into chips that are on the RAM and store our data.
        Just like with the CPU, make sure that your motherboard is compatible with any RAM sticks that you buy

    </p>

<div> <h2> motherboards </h2>
    <p> 
        key components of a motherboard: <br>
        chipset - decides how components talk to each other on our machine. The chipset on motherboards is made up of two chips. 
        One is called the Northbridge that interconnects stuff like RAM and video cards. The other chip is the Southbridge, which maintains our input-output controllers, like hard drives and USB devices, that input and output data.
        <br>
        The chipset is a key component of our motherboard that allows us to manage data between our CPU, RAM, and peripherals.
        <br>
        Peripherals are the external devices we connect to our computer, like a mouse, keyboard, and the monitor.
        <br> 
        Expansion slots also give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer. If you wanted to upgrade your graphics card, you could purchase one and just install it on your motherboard through the expansion slot.
        <br>
        form factor- There are different size of motherboards that are available today. These sizes of form factors determine the amount of stuff we can put in it and the amount of space we'll have.
        <br>

    <h2> Physical storage : Hard drives</h2>
    <p> 
        A bit can store one binary digit,
        byte is comprised of eight bits
         A kilobyte is made up of 1,024 bytes.
         There are two basic hard drive types used today. Hard describes or HDDs uses a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to read and write information. The speed that the platter rotate allows you to read and write data faster. This is commonly referred to as RPM or revolution per minute. 
          A hard drive with a higher RPM is faster.
         HDDs are prone to a lot more damage because there are a lot of moving parts, but they are more affodable.<br>
         This susceptibility to damage went away with a new type of storage called solid state drive or SSD. 
         SSDs have no moving parts. Are you familiar with a USB stick? SSDs operate in a similar way. The information is stored on microchips and data travels a lot faster than HDDs. The form factor for SSDs is also slimmer compared to HDD. <br>


    </p>
    <p> 
         There are a few interfaces that hard drives use to connect our system. ATA interfaces are the most common ones. The most popular ATA drive is a Serial ATA or SATA, which uses one cable for data transfers. 
         SATA drives are hot swappable, great term, don't you think? It means you don't have to turn off your machine to plug in a SATA drive. SATA drives move data faster and use a more efficient cable.
         The interface couldn't keep up with the speeds of the newest SSDs. <br>
         So another interface standard was created called NVM express, or NVMe.
         Instead of using a cable to connect your drive to your machine, the drive was added as an expansion slot, which allows for greater throughput of data and increased efficiency.
