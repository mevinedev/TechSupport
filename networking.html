        Network standards are designed to ensure that hardware and software made by different vendors work seamlessly together.
        Network standards provide a framework that enables the interoperability between devices.
        Primary function of a hub- Hubs offer the simplest form of network. They allow multiple Ethernet-based network-enabled devices to communicate with each other.
        Datagrams- packets of data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices. 
        Switch routing sends packets to specific devices.
        A router is a network device that forwards data packets between computer networks.

    </p>
    <p>
        A network is a collection of network-enabled devices, typically made up of computers, switches, routers, printers, and servers. Types: <br>
        1.  personal area network (PAN) provides networking needs around an individual eg bluetooth
        2.  local area network (LAN) provides networking needs around a single location. Are privately owned, need authentication and authorization.
        3. wide area network (WAN) provides networking capabilities between two different geographical locations locally or worldwide eg head office and branches all over the region. may use VPN to manage connection btwn different LANs 
        4. metropolitan area network (MAN) provides networking capabilities between two different locations within a city or metropolitan area to provide a single extensive network.

        network topology - describes the physical composition of a network.
        1. bus topology- each network device is connected to a single network cable. 
        2. ring topology - each network device is connected to its neighbor to form a ring.
        3. mesh- each network device connects to every other network device in the network.
        4. star topology- Each network device connects to a centralized hub or switch. Most robust and scalable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Network infrastructure devices: <br>
        1. repeater- is a two-port device that repeats network signals. Repeaters are used when network devices are some distance from each other. Regenerates the data packet at the original strength, bit by bit.
        2. bridge- divides a network into network segments, and can filter and forward data packets between these segments. improve network performance by reducing unnecessary network traffic on network segments.
        3. Hubs- used to connect more than one device and structure the layout of a network. contain multiple ports that act as an input/output Ethernet connection between the hub and a network device. sends copies of each data packet to all attached devices.
        4. switch combines the functionality of a bridge and a hub. It segments networks and can interpret and filter packet data to send it directly to an attached network device.operates in full-duplex mode, which means it can send and receive data to and from network devices at the same time.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Routers link networks with different ranged addresses together. They can interpret and filter data packets, and then forward them to the correct network. 

    </p>
    <p>
        network protocol is a set of conditions and rules that specify how network devices communicate on a given network. 
        routing - mechanism used to make sure that data packets follow the correct delivery path between the sending and receiving devices on different networks.

    </p>
    <p>
        protocol categories:
        1. network communication protocls - focus on establishing and maintaining a connection between devices.eg Transmission control protocol TCP- delivery of data packets across IP network,
        internet protocol- guarantees packet is delivered to the given address, User datagram protocol- no need to verify if datagram has been received.
        <li>
            TCP- delivery of data packets across IP network <br>
            IP- guarantees packet is delivered to the given address <br>
            UDP - no need to verify if datagram has been received. <br>
            HTTP -deliver web page content from a server to your browser <br>
            FTP-  transfer files between different computers on a network - file transfer protocol <br>
            email protocols: 
            <li>
                POP3- allow you to receive emails
                SMTP- send emails
                IMAP - manage single mailbox
            </li>
        </li>
        2. Network security protocols -are designed to maintain the security of data across your network. use encryption and cryptographic principles to secure messages
        eg secure socket layer, transport layer security, Kerberos.
        <li>
            SSL - provides a secure and encrypted connection between your computer and the target server.
            TLS- designed to stop message forgery and tampering and eavesdropping -Transport layer security. 
            HTTPS- combines TLS and SSL- hypertext transfer protocol secure
            Secure Shell SSL- is a cryptographic network security protocol that provides a secure data connection across a network.
            Kerberos- authentication for client-server-based applications through secret-key cryptography.
        </li>
        3. Network management protocols -focus on the sustainability of the network by looking at faults and performance.eg simple network management protocol SNMP- allows for the collection of data from devices on your network and the management of those devices, internet control message protocol ICMP -It allows network-connected devices to send warning and error messages, along with operation information about the success or failure of a connection request, or if a service is unavailable.
        <li>
            SNMP-  allows for the collection of data from devices on your network and the management of those devices. protocol that's used to gather and organize information on your IP network.
            ICMP-used to send information about the success or failure of any network operation. allows network-connected devices to send warning and error messages, along with operation information about the success or failure of a connection request, or if a service is unavailable. 
        </li>

        port is a logical construct that allows the routing of incoming messages to specific processes. 
        A port is an unsigned 16-bit number from 0 to 65535. The first 1,024 ports, called the well-known port numbers, are reserved for the commonly used services. The high-numbered ports, called the ephemeral ports, are unreserved and used by dedicated applications.

        internet protocol suite - TCP/IP: <br>
        describes the different layered protocols used to send and receive data on the internet and similar networks.
        1. Application layer - is concerned with application or process communication. eg SMTP for email. includes HTTP, DNS, IMAP, SMTP, SNMP, SSH, TLS , SSL.
        2. Transport layer -The protocols associated with this layer are TCP and UDP. TCP is responsible for flow control. UDP is responsible for providing a datagram service. Has TCP and UDP.
        3. Internet layer -responsible for exchanging datagrams. A datagram contains the data from the transport layer and adds in the origin and recipient IP addresses.protocols are IP,IPV4, IPV6, ICMP, IPsec.
        4. Network access layer -defining how the data is sent across the network.protocols eg ARP,MAC, Ethernet, digital subscriber line (DSL), and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).
    </p>
    <p>
        Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) -is a communications protocol within the Internet Protocol suite.
        It is a request-response protocol used to resolve the media access control (MAC) address for a given IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
        TCP/IP Is a protocol used to interconnect network devices on the internet.
        Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is a collection of different communication protocols that support and define how network-enabled devices interconnect with each other over an IP-based network. 
        It defines the way data is shared between network-enabled devices by defining the end-to-end communication process, also determines how the packet is addressed and transmitted, routed, and received.

        Internet protocol:
        IPV4 - The structure of an IPv4 address is four decimal numbers in the range of 0 to 255 in dotted decimal format.An example is 192.168.0.1.
         has two parts to an IP address, the network and the host, eg the last part is the host. <br>
        A subnet is the logical subdivision of an IP-based network. <br>
        A subnet defines one or more logical networks within the class A, B, or C network.  A subnet, or host address, represents which network or subnetwork to use.
        A subnet is a 32-bit number framed by using the dotted-decimal format. For example, 255.255.255.0 is a standard subnet mask. Subnets allow multiple subnetworks to exist within one network. They can be used to enhance routing performance. Subnets can be arranged hierarchically to create routing trees. <br>
        IPv6 -was created to increase the number of IP address spaces to 128 bits. Benefits include: simplified network configuration, security-inbuilt IPsec, new service support -due to eliminating need for NAT, Multicast and anycast functionality.
        Multicast allows for the broadcast of messages in a one-to-many fashion. Anycast allows a single destination to have multiple routing paths to two or more endpoint destinations.
        Structure of IPV6: eight groups of four hexadecimal numbers called a hexadectet. Each hexadectet is separated with a colon. A full IPv6 address looks like this: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
        all instances of zeros can be removed. thus shortened version is is 2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334.

        Domain Name System DNS- s a decentralized lookup service that translates a human-readable domain name or URL into the IP address of the server that's hosting the site or service.
        The DNS helps resolve domain names to IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accessing a private network from the internet -The private network needs special access via a gateway. A private network can access another private network by using network address translation.
