    <div><h2>Basics of networking </h2>
        <p>
            Networking refers to managing, building, and designing networks. 
            The Internet is just an interconnection of computers around the world. A network is an interconnection of computers.
             Computers in a network can talk to each other and send data to one another. <br>
            The Internet is the physical connection of computers and wires around the world. 
             The web is the information on the Internet. We use it to access the Internet through a link like www.google.com.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            We don't actually connect to the Internet directly. Instead, computers called servers connect directly to the Internet.
             Servers store the websites that we use, like Wikipedia, Google, Reddit, and BBC. These websites serve content. 
             The machines that we use, like our mobile phones, laptops, video game consoles, and more are called clients. 
             Clients request the content like pictures, websites from the servers. Clients don't connect directly to the Internet.
              Instead, they connect to a network run by an Internet service provider or ISP, like CenturyLink, Level 3, Comcast, Telefonica. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Computers on a network have an identifier called an IP address. An IP address is composed of digits and numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we move data through the network, we break them down into packets. 
        </p>

    </div>
    <div> <h2> Networking hardware</h2>
        <p> 
            Ways of connecting to a network: <br>
         An ethernet cable which lets you physically connect to the network through a cable.
             On the back of the desktop, there are network ports that you plug your ethernet cable into. <br>
         Wi-Fi, which is wireless networking. <br>
         Fiber optic cable- llow greater speeds than all the other methods,the cables contain glass fibers that move data through light instead of electricity. 
         This means that we send ones and zeros through a beam of light instead of an electrical current through a copper wire. <br>  
         A router- connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic. <br>
         switches and hubs - devices that help our data travel. <br> 
         Thus, network stack is all the components that makes up computer networking.  ( a network stack is  a set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer)  
        </p>    
    </div>
    <div> <h2> Network protocols </h2>
        <p>
            Network protocols are a set of rules for how we transfer data in a network. eg TCP/IP. 
            The Internet Protocol, or IP, is responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers.
            The Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, is a protocol that handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div> <h2> The web</h2>
        <p> 
            Websites are basically text documents that we format with HTML or HyperText Markup Language.
            Web pages contain multimedia content like text, images, audio and video. 
            A URL which stands for Uniform Resource Locator is just a web address similar to a home address.
            Once a domain name is registered with, ICANN, no one else can take that name unless it becomes available again.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div> <h2> Limitations of the internet</h2>
        <p>
            There are actually different versions of IP addresses. <br> 
            The current protocol, Internet protocol version four, or IPV4, is an address that consists of 32 bits separated into four groups.
            The number of usable IP addresses is even less. <br>
            IPV6 or Internet Protocol version 6 addresses, IPV6 addresses consists of 128 bits, four times the amount that IPV4 uses, 
            which means way more devices can have IP addresses. The adoption of IPV6 addresses has been slow but steady.
            With IPV6, there are two to the 128th power possible IP addresses. <br>
            NAT or Network Address Translation.
            This lets organizations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network. 
            Now, instead of companies using hundreds of public IP addresses, they can just use one IP address. <br>
