        <div>
            <p>
                There are two main parts to an operating system, the kernel and the user space. 
                The kernel is the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our system's resources. 
                kernel functions include file management, program/resource management by using process scheduler, memory management, inputoutput IO management 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <h2> file management</h2> <br>
                There are three main components to handling files handlers, the file data, metadata, and file system.
                file system : eg NTFS includes many features like encryption, faster access speeds, security, and more. for windows
                EX T4, for Linux,  which is compatible with older EXT file systems. 
                A file extension is the appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems. eg JPG.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div> <h2> Process management</h2> <br>
            <p>
                A process is a program that's executing, A program is an application that we can run.
                The CPU executes processes one-by-one through something known as a time slice.
                 A time slice is a very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution. 
                 The kernel creates processes, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated
            </p>    

        </div>
        <div> <h2> Memory management and virtual memory </h2><br>
            <p>
                Virtual memory is the combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use. 
                When we execute a process, we take the data of the program in chunks we call pages.
                We store these pages in virtual memory. If we want to read and execute these pages, they have to be sent to physical memory or RAM.
            </p>
            <p> 
                When we store our virtual memory on our hard drive, we call the allocated space swap space. When we get into practical applications of disk partitioning, we'll allocate space for swap. 
                The kernel takes care of all of this for us. It handles the process of taking pages of data and swapping them between RAM and virtual memory.
                But, the Kernel isn't the only hard worker around. You've done great getting through the lessons so far. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div> <h2> I/O management</h2> <br>
        <p>
            kernel handles input and output. 
            I/O devices include monitors, keyboards, mice, hard disk drives, speakers, Luther's headsets, webcams and network adapters.
            the kernel needs to be able to load up drivers that are used so that we can recognize and speak to these different types of hardware.
            When the kernel is able to start the drivers to communicate with hardware, it also manages the transfer of data in and out of the devices.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div> <h2> User Interface </h2> <br>
        <p> 
            There are two ways that we can interact with our OS. With a shell or graphical user interface.
            There are also some shells that use graphical user interfaces, but we'll work with a Command Line Interface or CLI shell. <br>
            A Graphical User Interface or GUI is a visual way to interact with the computer.
            
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div> <h2> Logs </h2> <br>
        <p> 
            Logs are files that record system events on our computer, just like a system's diary. 
            A computer will record events like when it was turned on, when a driver was loaded. And even when something isn't working in the form of error messages. 
            In all operating systems, logs are kept so we can refer back to them when we need to find out something that happened.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div> <h2> Boot process </h2> <br>
        <p> 
        <h2> The boot process </h2>
            First, the computer is powered on. The BIOS/UEFI is a low-level software that initializes our computer's hardware to make sure everything is good to go. Next, the bios UEFI runs a process called the power-on self-test, or post. The post performs a series of diagnostic tests to make sure that the computer is in proper working order. <br> 
            Next, depending on the bios or UEFI configuration of boot device will be selected. <br>
            Next, the bios UEFI runs a process called the power-on self-test, or post. The post performs a series of diagnostic tests to make sure that the computer is in proper working order. <br> 
            Next, depending on the bios or UEFI configuration of boot device will be selected. Devices that are attached to our system, like hard drives, USB drives, CD drives, etc, are configured in a certain boot order.
              The devices will be checked in this order and the computer will search for what's known as a bootloader. 
            <br> The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system. Once our computer finds a bootloader on a device in the listed order, it will start to execute this program. This will then start to load a larger and more complex program and eventually loads our operating system.
            Once the bootloader loads up our operating system, our kernel gets loaded. The kernel controls access to our computer's resources. 
            It also loads up drivers and more so that our hardware can talk to our software. <br>
            Next, essential system processes and user space items are launched. These include processes like user login, spinning up a desktop environment, and more which basically allows us to interact with our system. 
            And that's it. After these simple steps, you'll be able to get to work.                      
        </p>
    </div>

    <div> <h2> Boot methods  </h2> <br>
        <p> 
            Internal method : A computer can be partitioned into different operating systems and you can select which OS to use when booting.
            External method :  boot from an external tool. External tools include USB drives - This drive is inserted into a USB port and chosen at startup,
            <br> optical media - You use a disk loaded with booting resources. This disk can be a DVD, CD, or Blu-ray disk and is loaded through the computer's optical drive.
            <br> solid state boot drives - You use a solid state drive to boot. Solid state drives do not use spinning discs or moving parts. This solid state drive can be installed in your computer or can be a smaller device such as a flash drive. 
            <br> external hot-swappable drives - You boot from an external hard drive that can be moved between computers without turning it off. 
            <br> network booting -  You boot the operating system directly from a local area network (LAN) without using a storage device. Your computer must be connected to a LAN for this option. 
            <br> internet-based booting - You boot the computer from an internet source, as long as it is a secure source. Your computer must be connected to the internet for this option.
             
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In order to boot either Windows OS or Linux OS with an external tool, you will need to enter BIOS at startup by pressing F2/F12/Del keys.
            From there you can change the boot order so that the first option is the external tool you want to use. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If booting macOS, press and hold the Option key at startup. This will open up the Startup Manager, which will scan your computer and identify bootable devices. 
            Then you can choose the bootable device you want to use.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div> <h3> Choosing an OS </h3><br>
        <p>
            consider: 
            <li>
                organization's specifications for OS
                software to run on the devices if it is OS specific or cross-platform 
                hardware to be used - if supported by the OS
                CPU compatibility with OS eg 64bit CPU is compatible with 64bit OS                
            </li>
        </p>
     </div>

     <div> <h3> Virtual machines </h3> <br>
        <p> 
            A virtual machine is just a copy of a real machine.
            Use an application like Virtual Box to install Linux, and have it completely isolated from my machine. 
            Virtual machines use physical resources like memory, CPU, and storage, but they offer the added benefit of running multiple operating systems at once. They're also easier to maintain and provision. 
        </p>
         
        <p>  If you wanted to use software that's only available on one specific OS, it's easier to create a new virtual machine. Use the software and then delete the virtual machines once you're done.</p>
         <p> use touch command or mkdir command  to create file in linux </p>
