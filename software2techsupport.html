        software is the intangible instructions that tell the hardware what to do. <br>
        Coding is basically translating one language to another. <br>
        Scripting is coding in a scripting language. <br>
        Programming is coding in a programming language. <br>
        Programming languages are special languages that software developers use to write instructions for computers to execute. <br>
        Script -  is usually used to perform a single- or limited-range task, when writing a code. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Common scripting languages: <br>
            Windows environments: batch scripts (.bat), Powershell (.ps1), Visual Basic Script (.vbs) <br>
            Linux/Unix environments: shell scripts (.sh) <br>
            Most OS environments: javascript (.js), Python (.py)
        </p>

        <p>
         uses of scripting: <br>
         Basic Automation <br>
         Restarting Machines <br>
         Remapping Network Drives <br>
         Installing Applications <br>
         Automating Backups <br>
         Gathering of information/ data <br>
         Initiating Updates <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            risks in using scripts: <br>
            Unintentionally introducing malware <br>
            Inadvertently changing system settings <br>
            Browser or system crashes due to mishandling of resources

               Open-source s/w - A type of software that can allow freedom of use, modification, and sharing. <br>
               Application software is any software created to fulfill a specific need, like a text editor, web browser, or graphic editor. <br>
               System software is software used to keep our core system running, like operating system tools and utilities. eg 
               Firmware is software that's permanently stored on a computer component eg BIOS which helps start up the hardware on your computer, and also helps load up your operating system.               
            </p> 

            <p>
                The principle of abstraction, allows us to use programming languages to write instructions that can be run on any hardware.
            </p>

            <p>
                Assembly language allowed computer scientists to use human readable instructions assembled into code that the machines could understand. 
            Instead of generating binary code, computer scientists could program using machine instructions.
            A compiled programming language uses human readable instructions and sends them through a compiler. The compiler takes the human instructions and compiles them into machine instructions. 
            </p>

            As an IT professional, it is important to check the license agreement of any software before you install it. Some of them could require you to pay for a license in order to use it.
            System Software is software used to keep our core system running, like operating system tools and utilities.
            As an IT professional, you may need to improve workflow efficiency by automating basic functions with a scripting language.
        </p>

            Compilers are a key component to programming, and helped to pave the road that led us to today's modern computing.
            A compiled programming language sends human readable instructions through a compiler. The compiler takes the human instructions and compiles them into machine instructions.

                Exe is a file extension found in Windows for an executable file.
                Use the “uninstall” command button to remove programs.
                Git is a version control system that helps keep track of changes made to files and directories.

                Linux
                apt is a command we use in Ubuntu for package installs.
                Adding sudo command before the apt command tells Linux you are authorized to install software.

                run in your termonal : sudo apt install git, then press Y for yes, enter
                to uninstall : sudo apt remove git 
                dpkg -s vlc // if vlc is installed

        <div> <h2> Software automation </h2>
            <p> 
                Automation makes processes work automatically. You can even use the tools of automation like programs and scripts to help you with troubleshooting issues. 
                Instead of reading hundreds of lines of log files manually to discover when a particular error occurred on a computer, you could write a script to read the log for you and print out only the relevant line.
