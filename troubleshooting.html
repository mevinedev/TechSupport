                Troubleshooting is the ability to diagnose and resolve a problem. 
                The power of isolating a problem can quickly and effectively help you figure out where the issue lies. 
                The isolate-the-problem method is meant to shrink the scope of your problem so that you know you're looking in the right area. After you continually isolate the problem you'll eventually end up at the root cause.
                Root cause is the main factor that's causing a range of issues. Finding the root cause is a critical concept in IT support because it means that you're able to prevent an issue from happening again and again to multiple users.
            </p>
            <p>
            following the cookie crumb: <br>
            It's best to start from the very first air, which may be causing a cascade of errors. By fixing the root error, you'll correct all the other ones in the process.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Remember to start with the quickest step first, your time and your users time are important.
            </p>
            <p> <h4> pitfalls to avoid </h4>
                Don't default to autopilot mode-  Ask questions and gather data so you can fully understand an issue. <br>
                Not finding the root cause - Spend a little extra time investigating the issue instead of trying to fix all the small holes. <br>                
            </p>

        <div> <h3> customer service </h3>
            <p>
                In IT support, you work with users to fix technology and improve how people use it. To accomplish this, you need to develop a trust between you and the user.
                key concepts of customer service include: <br>
                <li>
                    Empathy - You're able to see something from someone else's perspective and understand their feelings.
                    Tone -  how you come off during an in person conversation, how you write, punctuate, and even spell.
                    Acknowledge the user. This reduces the tension that might build and helps you understand how you're working toward a solution. 
                    
                </li>
                Great customer service requires exhibiting empathy, being mindful of your tone, acknowledging the person you're talking to, and developing trust with the user. <br>
                Remember to integrate the information you've been given into your conversation. T Make sure to end on a positive note.

        <div> <h3> Ticketing and documenting </h3>
            <p>
                it's important to document the work you do.
                tickets are common way of documenting an issue. <br>
                Bugs are issues with the system that weren't caused by an external source. <br>

            </p>
            <p>
                Ticketting systems eg Bugzilla, JIRA and Redmine. These are all in one solutions that help you track user issues, communicate with your users and provide updates.
                A great way to use the system for documentation is to update the ticket with what the issue is.
            </p>
            <p>
                A great way to use the system for documentation is to update the ticket with what the issue is. 
                The steps and procedures you're trying to resolve and the solution you arrived at. <br> 
                importance:
                keeps the user in the loop. 
                The second is that it helps you audit your steps in case you need to go back and see what you did. 
                You can also write down procedures and policies to create a documentation trail.
                Remember to update your documentations.
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                example of documentation: fter making the corresponding question, I found out that the root cause was that the user was using heavy applications at the same time. Ask to close the application not in use.

                Lastly, once you have an interview scheduled, make sure you know where to go when you need to be there and what the appropriate attire is for the interview. 


            </p>
            <p> 
                You also need to share your ideas clearly and concisely, for example, take some general technical subjects like DHCP, DNS, Active Directory, or any other technical area you've learned about.
                Have a friend or family member ask you to explain the concept to them. What's it for? How is it used? Practicing explanations for a non-technical audience will get used to breaking down complicated ideas and sharing them in basic terms.
                They can also create their own troubleshooting scenarios like asking you to explain what you did the last time you fix their printer or got their network online. While you're practicing answering questions you should also practice active listening habits, maintain eye contact with the other person.
                <br> Make sure to include information like what you're passionate about, how you would like to grow, and what you're looking for in a new role.
                An elevator pitch is a short summary of who you are and what kind of career you're looking for. <br>
                the key to getting interviews right is to practice practice practice. This will help you feel less nervous and show your best self during the actual interviews.
                example of elevator pitch: <br>
                Hi! I’m Mevv, I studied Computer Science, currently awaiting graduation. I enjoy being able to help people and solve problems, so I’m looking forward to putting my tech skills into practice by working as an IT Support Specialist. 
                
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                you'll likely have one or more interviews where you'll specifically need to demonstrate your technical skills and knowledge. These interviews may take the form of technical troubleshooting scenarios or explanations of technical concepts and subjects. 
                <br>  As an IT support specialist, you should expect to often face new and unfamiliar problems. Having a good problem solving strategy is more important than knowing all the answers. 
                <br> When you mention concepts or technologies, you should be ready to explain them and articulate why you might choose one thing over another. For instance, if you're working through a networking problem and say something like, the problem might be related to the DNS settings. Be ready to explain what DNS is, and why it relates to the issue. You should also clarify the questions constraints. Don't assume anything, it's okay and even expected to ask the interviewer follow up questions.
                <br> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Be fully present for the duration of the interview.
                <br> Use those active listening skills that you've practiced. Make eye contact, nod, indicate understanding, and ask follow-up questions.
                <br> Don't forget to be yourself. You want the interviewer to remember you, so let your personality show. Make sure that you highlight what makes you unique.
